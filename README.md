# LanguageTransition
It extracts audio from the video, converts it into text, and translates it into the preferred language. Then, it clones the voice of the speaker by learning from a set of audios and converts the audio into the preferred language while retaining the tone and voice of the speaker.


Frequently, we encounter many tools that facilitate language transition, but they often produce audio in a robotic manner. But what if we need to preserve the voice and tone of the individual? Here is a tool that can help achieve just that!

Step 1: It extracts audio  from a video and converts it into text using whisper.

Step 2: The transcribed text is then translated into the language of your choice using Google Translate.

Step 3: To ensure that the speaker's voice and tone remain unchanged, simply provide our system with a minimum of 10 audio samples in .wav format for training.

Step 4: It converts the trnslated text to Audio using TTS.


In a matter of moments, you'll have your transformed audio ready to captivate your audience. This tool is a game-changer for anyone who values the authenticity and impact of their content.
